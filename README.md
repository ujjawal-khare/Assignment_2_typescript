Income/Expense manager in typescript

## Must to have 
 - [x] Show a textarea where the user can input the CSV string, along with a submit button.
 - [x] On receiving the CSV data, validate the CSV input. If there is an error, show an alert to the user telling them about the error. If the data is correct, convert it into an array of objects that you can use later as a data store. Clear the input field once done.
